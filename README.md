To run this:
1) go to "chrome://extensions"
2) turn on developer mode (top right corner of the page)
3) click "load unpacked"
4) choose the trailmix folder
5) should show up in your extensions list

The files:
We haven't put them in their respective folders yet
the .png/.jpg: are just the images for the extension
Manifest.json: is the manifest for the extension
popup.html: is the main html page (so like the index.html)
options.html: and options.js are not being used (it was part of the turtorial i watched on making an extension)
login-page.js: is also not used (I made this as an attempt to figure out the problem)
background.js: I don't really know what this is for
config.php: was for the connection to the database (however it is currently not being used)
jquery-3.6.0.min.js: i had to downlaod this to use jquery
popup.js: something i was also trying but didn't work
preferences.html: is the page that shows the preferences (the document icon)
profile1.html: the login page (the person icon)
profile2.html: after a person logs in they are redirected to a page that says they are logged in
refresh.html: the refresh page (the refresh icon)
signup.html: if the user doesnt have an account they can signup (button on the profile page)
require.js: tried to downlaod this to get something to work but ended up deleteing that
trailmix.css: the style sheet (honestly is not well commented)
userdb.js: was the jquery I was trying to work with (with .ajax)
user-db.js: was something i was trying but also didnt work
users_db.php: currently what i was trying to use to connect the MYSQL with the extension

The Problem:
    cant get php to work. Would like to use Node.js if possible.
    However if someone can figure out PHP then we can use that too,
    but would prefer Node.js and any associated libraries for Node.js.
